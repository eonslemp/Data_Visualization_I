Another goal of data visualization could be to create an interactive display of results as an end product. \n",

In the example above, age has been split into bins, with each bin representing a 10-year period starting at 20 years. Each bin contains the number of occurrences of scores in the data set that are contained within that bin. For the above data set, the frequencies in each bin have been tabulated along with the scores that contributed to the frequency in each bin (see below):\n",

Additionally, in histograms we so not have spaces between the bars like we do in bar charts."
